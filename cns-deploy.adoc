## Deploying Container-Native Storage
In this section you will set up Container-Native Storage (CNS) in your
environment. You will use this in link:../cns-management["Container-Native
Storage Management"] lab to dynamically provision storage for containerized
applications. It is provided by GlusterFS running in containers. GlusterFS in
turn is backed by local storage devices available to the OpenShift nodes.
This lab requires that you completed OpenShift installation in the previous
module.

### Preparation for CNS
All of the following tasks are carried out as the `cloud-user` user on the
master node _{{ MASTER_EXTERNAL_FQDN }}_. Before the deployment a couple of
simple prerequisites need to be fulfilled.

#### Check the Prerequisites
First, on the master, verify that the CNS deployment tool is installed. We
will also use Ansible to apply the firewall configuration across all 3 nodes.
Though not needed for CNS per se, in this lab it will help us simplify an
otherwise tedious manual configuration step.

----
yum list installed cns-deploy
----

The command should return the following:

----
Loaded plugins: product-id, search-disabled-repos, subscription-manager
This system is not registered with an entitlement server. You can use subscription-manager to register.
Installed Packages                cns-deploy.x86_64               4.0.0-19.el7rhgs               @rh-gluster-3-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
----

#### Configure OpenShift Node firewall with Ansible
Just as Ansible was used to install and configure OpenShift, you will configure
Ansible to take care of certain CNS prerequisites and installation steps.

There is a host group in `/etc/ansible/hosts` for the three nodes that will
initially run CNS. There are three more hosts, currently commented out, for
future use.

You should be able to "ping" the first 3 OpenShift App nodes using Ansible:

----
ansible cns -m ping
----

This should result in the following:

----
{{NODE1_EXTERNAL_FQDN}} | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
{{NODE2_EXTERNAL_FQDN}} | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
{{NODE3_EXTERNAL_FQDN}} | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

This verifies the systems can be reached and configure via Ansible. For the
firewall configuration in this lab is a preapred file in the `support` folder
called `configure-firewall.yaml`. This is a short Ansible playbook that will
configure the firewall to allow GlusterFS-related traffic (namely on ports
24007,24008, 2222 and 49152-49664 - all TCP), required for CNS. Run it with
the following command:

----
ansible-playbook /opt/lab/support/configure-firewall.yaml
----

Feel free to examine the playbook file if you are curious. When the Ansible
play completes successfully, your output should look like the following:

----
PLAY [nodes] *******************************************************************

{{NODE3_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}          : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
----

#### Prepare OpenShift for CNS
It makes sense to create a dedicated *Project* to hold the *Pods* that CNS will
use to provide storage inside the OpenShift environment. First, log-in as the
cluster administrator:

----
oc login -u system:admin
----

Create a *Project* called `{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}`:

----
oc new-project {{CNS_NAMESPACE}}
----

In CNS, the *Pods* running GlusterFS need access to the physical block devices on the host. OpenShift's security model prevents that behaviour by default. In order to provide the permissions required, you will need to enable a privileged operation mode for the *Pods*. Execute the following command, which will allow the `default` *ServiceAccount* to use the `privileged` *SecurityContextConstraint*:

----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default
----

[NOTE]
====
A deeper discussion of Security Context Constraints is outside of the scope of
these lab modules, but the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorization
documentation] provides a deeper dive into these concepts.
====

### Describe Container-Native Storage Topology
CNS will virtualize the locally attached block storage on the OpenShift nodes using GlusterFS.
In order to deploy CNS, though, you will need to supply the CNS installer with
information about where to find these nodes and what network and which block
devices to use. This is done using a JSON file that describes the topology of
the OpenShift environment.

There has already been a JSON file defined for you:

<1> heketi uses this FQDN to identify the node in OpenShift (e.g. oc get nodes)
<2> the IP address of the node used for GlusterFS traffic
<3> The failure domain of this node
<4> The host's storage device(s) to for GlusterFS

[NOTE]
====
The topology references the nodes by their hostnames as they are known to
OpenShift.
====

This file contains an additional property called `zone` per node. This
identifies the failure domain this host resides in.  In CNS data is always
replicated 3 times. By exposing information about the failure domains we can
make sure that two copies are never stored on nodes in the same failure domain.
The `zone` definitions are simply arbitrary, but unique integer values.

### Install Container-Native Storage
You are now ready to deploy CNS. Alongside CNS *Pods*, the API front-end
known as *heketi* is deployed. To protect this API from unauthorized access we
will define passwords for the `admin` and `user` role in heketi like below.

.CNS passwords
[width="60%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| Heketi Role     | Password
| admin           | {{HEKETI_ADMIN_PW}}
| user            | {{HEKETI_USER_PW}}
|==============================================

#### Run the CNS deployer
Next start the deployment routine with the following command:

----
cns-deploy -n {{CNS_NAMESPACE}} -g /opt/lab/support/topology.json --admin-key '{{HEKETI_ADMIN_PW}}' --user-key '{{HEKETI_USER_PW}}'
----

Answer the interactive prompts with *Y*.

The deployment will take several minutes to complete. Especially the step "Waiting for GlusterFS pods to start" might take some time. On the command line the output should look like this:


[NOTE]
====
Some of the output below contains auto-generated data, so references to UUIDs and pod
names might be slightly different for you.
====
----
Welcome to the deployment tool for GlusterFS on Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Before getting started, this script has some requirements of the execution
environment and of the container platform that you should verify.

The client machine that will run this script must have:
 * Administrative access to an existing Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
 * Access to a python interpreter 'python'
 * Access to the heketi client 'heketi-cli'

Each of the nodes that will host GlusterFS must also have appropriate firewall
rules for the required GlusterFS ports:
 * 2222  - sshd (if running GlusterFS in a pod)
 * 24007 - GlusterFS Daemon
 * 24008 - GlusterFS Management
 * 49152 to 49251 - Each brick for every volume on the host requires its own
   port. For every new brick, one new port will be used starting at 49152. We
   recommend a default range of 49152-49251 on each host, though you can adjust
   this to fit your needs.

In addition, for an OpenShift deployment you must:
 * Have 'cluster_admin' role on the administrative account doing the deployment
 * Add the 'default' and 'router' Service Accounts to the 'privileged' SCC
 * Have a router deployed that is configured to allow apps to access services
   running in the cluster

Do you wish to proceed with deployment?

[WARNING]
====
Due to the type of environment we are running this lab (system clock skew can occur temporarily) in, it is possible that the `cns-deploy` calls fails with an error like this:

----
[...]
Waiting for GlusterFS pods to start ... OK
service "deploy-heketi" created
route "deploy-heketi" created
deploymentconfig "deploy-heketi" created
Waiting for deploy-heketi pod to start ... OK
Error: Unable to get topology information: Token used before issued
Error loading the cluster topology.
----

In this case, clean up the installation with these commands:

----
cns-deploy -n {{CNS_NAMESPACE}} -g /opt/lab/support/topology.json --admin-key '{{HEKETI_ADMIN_PW}}' --user-key '{{HEKETI_USER_PW}}' --abort

ansible cns -m shell -a "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/xvdd bs=1M count=100 oflag=direct"
----

And re-run the command without the `--abort` switch.

It is also possible that the deployment routine doesn't wait long enough for the cluster to come up and `cns-deploy` may fail with this message:

----
[...]
service "heketi" created
route "heketi" created
deploymentconfig "heketi" created
Waiting for heketi pod to start ... OK
Failed to communicate with heketi service.
Please verify that a router has been properly configured.
----

This error is due to a timeout set too short. It can safely be ignored. Please proceed with the below instructions where we will explicitly verify that the service is indeed up and responding to API requests.

====

### Verifying and Exploring CNS
Now that CNS is installed, take some time to explore it and verify that all of
the components are in place.

#### Look at the Pods
While still in the `{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}` project on the CLI list all running
*Pods*:

----
oc get pods -o wide
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP              NODE
glusterfs-37vn8   1/1       Running   0          3m       {{NODE1_INTERNAL_IP}}         {{NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN}} <1>

----
<1> CNS *Pods*, with each of the designated nodes running exactly one.
<2> heketi API frontend pod

[NOTE]
====
The exact *Pod* names will be different in your environment, since they are
auto-generated. Also the heketi *Pod* might run on any node.
====

The CNS *Pods* use the host's network and block devices to run the
software-defined storage system. See schematic below for a visualization.

.GlusterFS pods in CNS in detail.
image::cns_diagram_pod.png[]

heketi is a component that will exposes an API into the storage system for
OpenShift. This allows OpenShift to dynamically allocate storage from CNS in a
programmatic fashion. See below for a visualization. Note that for simplicity,
in our example heketi runs on the OpenShift application nodes, not on the
infrastructure node.

.heketi pod running in CNS
image::cns_diagram_heketi.png[]

#### Examine heketi
To expose heketi's API a *Service* named _heketi_ has been created:

----
oc get service/heketi
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
heketi    172.30.5.231   <none>        8080/TCP   31m
----

In order to be able to use heketi outside of the OpenShift cluster (for
monitoring/data gathering, or other automation), a *Route* has been created. Verify this is the case by running:

----
oc get route/heketi
----

This should output the details, as well as the public URL of the `Route` for the heketi API:

----
NAME      HOST/PORT                                               PATH      SERVICES   PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
heketi    heketi-{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}             heketi     <all>                   None
----

You may verify the API is responding and heketi is alive with a trivial health check:

----
curl http://heketi-{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}/hello
----

This should return (likely without a line break)

----
Hello from Heketi
----

That's it. You have successfully provisioned Container-Native Storage on
OpenShift. CNS provides the basis to provide persistent storage to applications, as
demonstrated in the link:../cns-management["Container-Native Storage Management"]
module.

CNS is available wherever OpenShift is deployed with no external dependencies.

#### Exploring Container-Native Storage
Outside of the tight integration with OpenShift you can also work directly with
the administrative interface of heketi. This done via the command line client.
First, set the following environment variables to configure the client:

----
export HEKETI_CLI_SERVER=http://heketi-{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}
export HEKETI_CLI_USER=admin
export HEKETI_CLI_KEY={{HEKETI_ADMIN_PW}}
----

You'll notice how we use the route that OpenShift created for the heketi
*Service* to direct the client to the REST API. With username / password from
the `cns-deploy` command also set, you can query heketi about the clusters it's
managing:

----
heketi-cli cluster list
----

heketi will list all known clusters with internal UUIDs:

----
Clusters:
ec7a9c8be8327a54839236791bf7ba24 <1>
----
<1> This is the internal UUID of the CNS cluster

[NOTE]
====
The cluster UUID will be different for you since it's automatically generated.
====

This tells you that as part of running `cns-deploy` not only the heketi and CNS
*Pods* were started, but the 3 CNS *Pods* have also formed a cluster which is
now ready to serve replicated, software-defined storage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Please note the UUID for later reference in the next chapter.*
====

To get more detailed information about the topology of your CNS cluster (i.e.
nodes, devices and volumes heketi has discovered) run the following command
(output abbreviated):

----
heketi-cli topology info
----

You will get a lengthy output that describes the GlusterFS cluster topology as it is known by heketi:

### Dynamic Storage Provisioning
OpenShift supports dynamic storage provisioning for storage providers that have
APIs and where a kubernetes plug-in exists. This is a fairly simple framework in
which only 3 components exists: the storage provider, the storage volume and the
request for a storage volume.

.OpenShift Storage Lifecycle
image::cns_diagram_pvc.png[]

OpenShift knows non-ephemeral storage as "persistent" volumes. This is storage
that is decoupled from *Pod* lifecycles.  Users can request such storage by
submitting a *PersistentVolumeClaim* to the system, which carries aspects like
desired capacity or access mode (shared, single, read-only). A storage provider
in the system is represented by a *StorageClass* and is referenced in the claim.
Upon receiving the claim it talks to the API of the actual storage system to
provision the storage. The storage is represented in OpenShift as a
*PersistentVolume* which can directly be used by *Pods* to mount it.

With these basics defined we can configure our system for CNS. First we will set
up the credentials for CNS in OpenShift.

#### Configure the Secret
*Secrets* are a way to store private information, like passwords, certificates,
and more. You can learn more about *Secrets* in the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/dev_guide/secrets.html[secrets
documentation]

In our case, we want to provide the administrative password for CNS (the heketi
API, specifically) so that OpenShift can use it when provisioning or deleting
storage volumes.

The definition of this *Secret* is in a file `/opt/lab/support/cns-secret.yaml`. Feel free you use `cat` the display review this file. It contains a base64-encoded version of the heketi admin password that you used earlier when deploying CNS.

[source,yaml]
./opt/lab/support/cns-secret.yaml
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cns-secret
  namespace: default
data:
  key: bXlTM2NyM3RwYXNzdzByZA==
type: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
----

To create the *Secret* from this file, make sure you are still in the `{{ CNS_NAMESPACE }}` *Project*:

----
oc project {{ CNS_NAMESPACE }}
----

Then, you can create (instantiate) the *Secret*:

----
oc create -f /opt/lab/support/cns-secret.yaml
----

The *Secret* now stores the credentials for the heketi service in a hashed form. The *StorageClass* will use this to authenticate against the heketi API.

#### Create the Storage Class
To tell OpenShift about the existence of a dynamic storage provider, you use a
*StorageClass*. There is a definition file `/opt/lab/support/cns-storageclass.yaml` that describes the *StorageClass*
as well as references the *Secret* you just created. You will need to edit it
appropriately. Open the file with your favorite editor, and substitute
`INSERT-CLUSTER-ID-HERE` with the ID of your cluster.

Remmeber: you can get the CNS cluster ID from `heketi-cli cluster list`.

[source,yaml,role=copypaste]
.cns-storageclass.yaml
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: {{CNS_STORAGECLASS}}
  annotations:
    storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
parameters:
  resturl: "http://heketi-{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}" <1>
  restauthenabled: "true"
  restuser: "admin"
  volumetype: "replicate:3" <2>
  clusterid: "INSERT-CLUSTER-ID-HERE" <3>
  secretNamespace: "default" <4>
  secretName: "cns-secret" <5>
----
<1> The HTTP route OpenShift uses to expose the heketi API
<2> The only currently supported GlusterFS volume type: 3-way replication.
<3> *Use your cluster UUID here!*
<4> The namespace in which we created the secret file before
<5> The name of the secret which stores the heketi admin password

Create the *StorageClass*:

----
oc create -f /opt/lab/support/cns-storageclass.yaml
----

With these components in place, OpenShift can now dynamically provision storage
capacity from Container-Native Storage. The *StorageClass* has also been setup
as the system-wide default so that requests that don't request a particular
*StorageClass* will use this one and end up being served by CNS.

More information about dynamic storage provisioning in OpenShift can be found
in the

storage provisioning documentation].
