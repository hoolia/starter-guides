## Container-Native Storage Management
In this lab we are going to provide a view 'under the hood' of OpenShift
`PersistentVolumes` provided by CNS. For this purpose we will examine volumes
leveraged by example applications using different volume access modes.

### A Simple CNS Use Case

We are going to deploy a sample application that ships with OpenShift which
creates a PVC as part of the deployment. Log on to the system as
`fancyuser1`, using the password `openshift` and create a project with the
name `my-database-app`.

#### Create/Deploy the Application

----
oc login -u fancyuser1 -p openshift
oc new-project my-database-app
----

The example applications ships in form of ready-to-use resource templates. Enter
the following command to look at the template for a sample Ruby on Rails
application with a PostgreSQL database:

----
oc get template/rails-pgsql-persistent -n openshift -o yaml
----

This template creates a Rails Application instance which mimics a very basic
weblog. The articles and comments are saved in a PostgreSQL database which runs
in another pod. As part of the resource template a PVC is issued (line 194) to
supply the PostgreSQL pod with persistent storage with the mount point
`/var/lib/pgsql/data` (line 275). This will request a *PersistentVolume* in
`RWO` mode. Storage provided in this mode can only be mounted by a single pod at
a time.

[TIP]
====
If you want to see more about the parameters or other details of this template,
you can execute the following:

----
oc describe template rails-pgsql-persistent -n openshift
----
====

The storage size parameter in the template is called `VOLUME_CAPACITY`. The
`new-app` command will actually handle processing and interpreting a *Template*
into the appropriate OpenShift objects. We will specify that we want _5Gi_ of
storage as part of deploying a new app from the template as follows:

----
oc new-app rails-pgsql-persistent -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=5Gi
----

[NOTE]
====
The `new-app` command will automatically check for templates in the special
`openshift` namespace. In fact, `new-app` tries to do quite a lot of interesting
automagic things, including code introspection when pointed at code
repositories. It is a developer's good friend.
====

You will then see something like the following:

Go back to the OpenShift web console:

*{{WEB_CONSOLE_URL}}*

Make sure you are logged in as _fancyuser1_ and find your newly created project
`my-database-app`. You can now follow the deployment process. Alternatively, watch the
containers deploy from the command line like this:

[source]
----
oc get pods -w
----

You will see something like:

----

----

Exit out of the watch mode with kbd:[Ctrl + c] when you see the *-deploy and
*-hook-pre pods terminating.

[NOTE]
====
It may take up to 5 minutes for the deployment to complete, and you might not
see _exactly_ the same output, depending on when you first start watching (`-w`)
the *Pod* list.
====

You should now also see a PVC that has been issued and now being in the _Bound_
state.

----
oc get pvc
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME         STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
postgresql   Bound     pvc-9bb84d88-4ac6-11e7-b56f-2cc2602a6dc8   5Gi        RWO           4m
----

[TIP]
====
This PVC has been automatically fulfilled by CNS because the `cns-gold` *StorageClass*
was set up as the system-wide default in lab module link:cns-deploy["Deploying
Container-native Storage"]
====

#### Try the Application
Now go ahead and try out the application. The overview page in the OpenShift UI
will tell you the *Route* which has been deployed as well. Otherwise get it on
the CLI like this:

----
oc get route
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                      PATH      SERVICES                 PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
rails-pgsql-persistent   rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}            rails-pgsql-persistent   <all>                   None
----

Following this output, point your browser to:

*http://rails-pgsql-persistent-my-database-app.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}/articles*

The username/password to create articles and comments is by default
'openshift'/'secret'.

You should be able to successfully create articles and comments. When they are
saved they are actually saved in the PostgreSQL database which stores it's table
spaces on a GlusterFS volume provided by CNS.

[NOTE]
====
This application's template included a *Route* object definition, which is why
the *Service* was automatically exposed. This is a good practice.
====

#### Explore the Underlying CNS Artifacts
Now let's take a look at how this was deployed on the GlusterFS side. First you
need to acquire necessary permissions:

----
oc login -u system:admin
----

Select the example project of the user `fancyuser1` if not already/still selected:

----
oc project my-database-app
----

Look at the PVC to determine the PV:

----
oc get pvc
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME         STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
postgresql   Bound     pvc-9bb84d88-4ac6-11e7-b56f-2cc2602a6dc8   5Gi        RWO           17m
----

[NOTE]
====
Your PV name will be different as it's dynamically generated.
====

Look at the details of the PV bound to the PVC, in this case
`pvc-9bb84d88-4ac6-11e7-b56f-2cc2602a6dc8`:

----
oc describe pv/pvc-9bb84d88-4ac6-11e7-b56f-2cc2602a6dc8
----

You will see something like:

----
Name:		pvc-9bb84d88-4ac6-11e7-b56f-2cc2602a6dc8 <1>
Labels:		<none>
StorageClass:	cns-gold
Status:		Bound
Claim:		my-database-app/postgresql
Reclaim Policy:	Delete
Access Modes:	RWO
Capacity:	5Gi
Message:
Source:
    Type:		Glusterfs (a Glusterfs mount on the host that shares a pod's lifetime)
    EndpointsName:	glusterfs-dynamic-postgresql
    Path:		vol_e8fe7f46fedf7af7628feda0dcbf2f60 <2>
    ReadOnly:		false
No events.
----
<1> The unique name of this PV in the system OpenShift refers to
<2> The unique volume name backing the PV known to GlusterFS

Note the GlusterFS volume name, in this case *vol_e8fe7f46fedf7af7628feda0dcbf2f60*.

Now let's switch to the namespace we used for CNS deployment:

----
oc project container-native-storage
----

Look at the GlusterFS pods running and pick one (which one is not important):

----
oc get pods -o wide
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP              NODE
glusterfs-37vn8   1/1       Running   0          3m       {{NODE1_INTERNAL_IP}}         {{NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN}} <1>
glusterfs-cq68l   1/1       Running   0          3m       {{NODE2_INTERNAL_IP}}         {{NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN}} <1>
glusterfs-m9fvl   1/1       Running   0          3m       {{NODE3_INTERNAL_IP}}         {{NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN}} <1>
heketi-1-cd032    1/1       Running   0          1m       {{NODE3_INTERNAL_IP}}         {{NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN}} <2>
----

Remember the IP address of the pod you select, for example: *{{NODE1_INTERNAL_IP}}* of pod *glusterfs-37vn8*. +
Log on to the selected GlusterFS pod with a remote terminal session like so:

----
oc rsh glusterfs-37vn8
----

You have now access to this container's namespace which has the GlusterFS CLI utilities installed. +
Let's use them to list all known volumes:

----
sh-4.2# gluster volume list
----

You will see something like:

----
heketidbstorage <1>
vol_e8fe7f46fedf7af7628feda0dcbf2f60 <2>
vol_5e1cd71070734a3b02f58d822f89486a
vol_f2e8fda1d42a41efabbb4d4a3b4a5659
----
<1> A special volume dedicated to heketi's internal database.
<2> The volume backing the PV of the PostgreSQL database deployed earlier.

Query GlusterFS about the topology of this volume:

----
sh-4.2# gluster volume info vol_e8fe7f46fedf7af7628feda0dcbf2f60
----

You will see something like:

----
Volume Name: vol_e8fe7f46fedf7af7628feda0dcbf2f60

Options Reconfigured:
transport.address-family: inet
performance.readdir-ahead: on

----
<1> According to the output of `oc get pods -o wide` this is the container we are logged on to.

[NOTE]
====
Identify the right brick by looking at the host IP of the GlusterFS pod
you have just logged on to. `oc get pods -o wide` will give you this
information. The host's IP will be noted next to one of the bricks.
====

GlusterFS created this volume as a 3-way replica set across all GlusterFS pods,
in therefore across all your OpenShift App nodes running CNS. + Each pod/node
exposes it's local storage via the GlusterFS protocol. This local storage is
known as a *brick* in GlusterFS and is usually backed by a local SAS disk or
NVMe device. The brick is simply a directory on a block device formatted with
XFS and thus made available to GlusterFS.

You can even look at this yourself, by listing the files in the brick directory.
Select the brick's directory (the path starting with `/var/lib/heketi/...`)
marked in the output above:

----
sh-4.2# ls -ahl /var/lib/heketi/mounts/vg_0246fd563709384a3cbc3f3bbeeb87a9/brick_684a01f8993f241a92db02b117e0b912/brick
----

You will see something like:

----

You are looking at the PostgreSQL internal data file structure from the
perspective of the GlusterFS server side. It's a normal local filesystem here.

Clients, like the OpenShift nodes and their application pods talk to this
storage with the GlusterFS protocol. Which abstracts the 3-way replication
behind a single FUSE mount point. + When a pod starts that mounts storage from a
PV backed by GlusterFS, OpenShift will mount the GlusterFS volume on the right
app node and then _bind-mount_ this directory to the right pod. + This is
happening transparently to the application inside the pod and looks like a
normal local filesystem.

You may now exit your remote session to the GlusterFS pod.

sh-4.2# exit

### Providing Shared Storage With CNS
So far only very few options, like the basic NFS support, existed to provide a
*PersistentVolume* to more than one container at once. The access mode used for
this is `ReadWriteMany`. Traditional block-based storage solutions are not able
to do this.

With CNS this capability is now available to all OpenShift deployments, no
matter where they are deployed. To illustrate the benefit of this, we will
deploy a PHP application, a file uploader that has multiple front-end instances
sharing a common storage repository.+ To highlight the difference this makes to
non-shared storage we will first run this application without a PV.

#### Deploy a New Application
First log back in as `fancyuser1` using the password `openshift` and create a new project:

----
oc login -u fancyuser1 -p openshift
oc new-project my-shared-storage
----

Next deploy the example application:

----
oc new-app openshift/php:7.0~https://github.com/christianh814/openshift-php-upload-demo --name=file-uploader
----

You will see something like:

----
--> Found image a1ebebb (6 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/php" under tag "7.0" for "openshift/php:7.0"

    Apache 2.4 with PHP 7.0

    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "file-uploader"

You should kbd:[Ctrl + c] out of the tail mode once you see _Push successful_.

When the build is completed ensure the pods are running:

----
oc get pods
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
file-uploader-1-build            0/1       Completed   0          2m
file-uploader-1-k2v0d            1/1       Running     0          1m
...
----

Note the name of the single pod currently running the app, in the example above
`file-uploader-1-k2v0d`. The container called `file-uploader-1-build` is the
builder container and is not relevant for us. A service has been created for our
app but not exposed externally via a *Route* yet. Let's fix this:

----
oc expose svc/file-uploader
----

Check the *Route* that has been created:

----
oc get route
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                     HOST/PORT                                                      PATH      SERVICES                 PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
file-uploader            file-uploader-my-shared-storage.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}                      file-uploader            8080-tcp                 None
...
----

[NOTE]
====
This use of the `new-app` command directly asked for application code to be
built and did not involve a template. This is why a *Route* needs to be created
by hand.
====
Point your browser the the URL advertised by the route
(http://file-uploader-my-shared-storage.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}})

The application simply lists all file previously uploaded and offers the ability
to upload new ones as well as download the existing data. Right now there is
nothing.

Select an arbitrary from your local system and upload it to the app.

.A simple PHP-based file upload tool
image::uploader_screen_upload.png[]

After uploading a file validate it has been stored locally in the container by
following the link _List uploaded files_ in the browser or logging into it via a
remote session (using the name noted earlier):

----
oc rsh file-uploader-1-k2v0d
----

Once inside:

----
sh-4.2$ cd uploaded
sh-4.2$ pwd
/opt/app-root/src/uploaded
sh-4.2$ ls -lh
----

You should see something like:

----
total 16K
-rw-r--r--. 1 1000080000 root 16K May 26 09:32 cns-deploy-4.0.0-15.el7rhgs.x86_64.rpm.gz
----

[NOTE]
====
The exact name of the *Pod* will be different in your environment.
====

The app should also list the file in the overview:

.The file has been uploaded and can be downloaded again
image::uploader_screen_list.png[]

This pod currently does not use any persistent storage. It stores the file
locally.

[CAUTION]
====
Never attempt to store persistent data in a *Pod*. *Pods* and their containers are
ephemeral by definition, and any stored data will be lost as soon as the *Pod*
terminates.
====

Let's see when this become a problem. Exit out of the container shell:

----
sh-4.2$ exit
----

Let's scale the deployment to 3 instances of the app:

----
oc scale dc/file-uploader --replicas=3
----

Eventually, the additional *Pods* get spawned:

----
oc get pods
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
file-uploader-1-3cgh1            1/1       Running     0          20s
file-uploader-1-3hckj            1/1       Running     0          20s
file-uploader-1-build            0/1       Completed   0          4m
file-uploader-1-k2v0d            1/1       Running     0          3m
...
----

[NOTE]
====
The pod names will be different in your environment since they are automatically
generated.
====

When you log on to one of the new instances (one of the ones with an age much
smaller than the others) you will see they have no data:

----
oc rsh file-uploader-1-3cgh1
----

And then:

----
sh-4.2$ cd uploaded
sh-4.2$ pwd
/opt/app-root/src/uploaded
sh-4.2$ ls -hl
----

You'll notice that the file is gone:

----
total 0
----

Similarly, other users of the app will sometimes see your uploaded files and
sometimes not - whenever the load balancing service in OpenShift points to the
*Pod* that has the file stored locally. You can simulate this with another
instance of your browser in "Incognito mode" pointing to your app.

The app is of course not usable like this. We can fix this by providing shared
storage to this app.

You can create a *PersistentVolumeClaim* and attach it into an application with
the `oc volume` command. Execute the following

[source]
----
oc volume dc/file-uploader --add --name=my-shared-storage \
-t pvc --claim-mode=ReadWriteMany --claim-size=5Gi \
--claim-name=my-shared-storage --mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded
----

This command will:

* create a *PersistentVolumeClaim*
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to include a `volume` definition
* update the *DeploymentConfig* to attach a `volumemount` into the specified
  `mount-path`
* cause a new deployment of the application *Pods*

For more information on what `oc volume` is capable of, look at its help output
with `oc volume -h`. Now, let's look at the result of adding the volume:

----
oc get pvc
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE
my-shared-storage   Bound     pvc-62aa4dfe-4ad2-11e7-b56f-2cc2602a6dc8   5Gi        RWX           22s
...
----

Notice the `ACCESSMODE` being set to *RWX* (short for `ReadWriteMany`, equivalent
to "shared storage"). Without this `ACCESSMODE`, OpenShift will not attempt to
attach multiple *Pods* to the same *PersistentVolume*. If you attempt to scale
up deployments that are using `ReadWriteOnce` storage, they will actually fail.

The app is now re-deploying (in a rolling fashion) with the new settings - all
pods will mount the volume identified by the PVC under
`/opt/app-root/src/upload`.

You can watch the redeployment like this:

----
oc logs dc/file-uploader -f
----

And you may see:

----
--> Scaling up file-uploader-2 from 0 to 3, scaling down file-uploader-1 from 3 to 0 (keep 3 pods available, don't exceed 4 pods)
    Scaling file-uploader-2 up to 1
    Scaling file-uploader-1 down to 2
    Scaling file-uploader-2 up to 2
    Scaling file-uploader-1 down to 1
    Scaling file-uploader-2 up to 3
    Scaling file-uploader-1 down to 0
--> Success
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The logs for the *DeploymentConfig* will only be available / look like the above
if you attempt to view them _*during*_ the deployment. Once the deployment has
completed, you will see something very different:

----

----

Don't worry. Nothing is wrong. There is actually a `deployer` *Pod* that handles
the deployment, and it disappears once the deployment is complete. You are
seeing the logs for this deployer in the above example (`Scaling up...`).
====

The new config `file-uploader-2` will have 3 pods all sharing the same storage.

----
oc get pods
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                             READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
file-uploader-1-build            0/1       Completed   0          18m

file-uploader-2-xbz24            1/1       Running     0          1m
...
----

Try it out in your application: upload new files and watch them being visible
from within all application pods. In the browser the application behaves
seamlessly as it circles through the pods between browser sessions (if you use
an incognito session or a different browser).

----
oc rsh file-uploader-2-jd22b

sh-4.2$ exit
----

That's it. You have successfully provided shared storage to pods throughout the
entire system, therefore avoiding the need for data to be replicated at the
application level to each pod.

With CNS this is available wherever OpenShift is deployed with no external
dependency.

### Increasing Storage Capacity in CNS

Once deployed there are two way in which to increase the storage capacity
offered by CNS. Either by adding additional nodes with storage to OpenShift
cluster or by adding additional storage devices to the existing nodes running
CNS.

#### Adding nodes to CNS

The pre-requisite of adding nodes to the CNS setup is that these nodes have been
added to the OpenShift cluster before. That is, increasing the storage capacity
of CNS this way is a two-step process:

1. Extend the OpenShift cluster with additional nodes
2. Add the newly added nodes to the CNS setup

Fortunately both steps are easy thanks to automation. In the preceeding
link:infra-mgmt-basics["Infrastructure Management Module"] you have already
added a second set of 3 nodes to the OpenShift cluster. + These have an
additional storage device available, so we will use those.

For the second step, adding these new nodes to the CNS setup, you generally have two options:

A. add the new nodes to the existing CNS storage cluster, provisioned in the
  module link:cns-deploy["Deploying Container-native Storage"]
B. add the new nodes to a new, independent CNS storage cluster, still managed by
  the single heketi API service

Option A is the straigt-forward choice when you just need more storage space.
For this you can start with a single additional node. Use option B when you need
a net-new, independent storage cluster for the sake of tenant isolation,
different geographical region or exposing different storage tiers as separate
clusters. For this, you need at least 3 new nodes. In this exercise we will
implement Option B.

The following action require elevated privileges in OpenShift. Login as cluster
admin and change to the CNS namespace:

----
oc login -u system:admin
oc project container-native-storage
----

First, identify the newly added nodes - the easiest way is to look at their uptime:

----
oc get nodes
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                         STATUS                     AGE
{{NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready                      3h
{{NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready                      50m <1>
{{MASTER_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   3h
{{NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready                      3h
{{INFRA_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready                      3h
{{NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready                      50m <1>
{{NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN}}   Ready                      3h
{{NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN}}     Ready                      50m <1>
----
<1> The nodes added in the previous lab

Now we need to make sure, that these new systems have the right firewall ports
opened. For simplicity, we will just re-execute the `configure-firewall.yaml`
from the link:cns-deploy["Deploying  Container-native Storage"] module against
these new systems.

First uncomment the additional nodes entries already prepared in the ansible
inventory file `/etc/ansible/hosts` (they are prefixed with `#addcns_`). +
You need `sudo` privileges to do that:

----
sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
----

Remove the comment to enable the new host group like so:

[source,ini]
./etc/ansible/hosts
----
[...]

[cns]
{{NODE1_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}
{{NODE2_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}
{{NODE3_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}
{{NODE4_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}
{{NODE5_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}
{{NODE6_EXTERNAL_FQDN}}

[...]
----

Then execute the `configure-firewall.yaml` playbook again:

----
ansible-playbook /opt/lab/support/configure-firewall.yaml
----

Next, add the following label to these nodes in order have the *DaemonSet* that
CNS is based upon schedule new GlusterFS pods on them:

----
oc get daemonset
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     NODE-SELECTOR           AGE
glusterfs   3         3         3         storagenode=glusterfs   3h
----
<1> The label definition the *DaemonSet* uses to select the nodes which run a
  GlusterFS pod.

----
oc label node/{{NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN}} storagenode=glusterfs
oc label node/{{NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN}} storagenode=glusterfs
oc label node/{{NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN}} storagenode=glusterfs
----

The *DaemonSet* will detect that new nodes have these labels, and GlusterFS
*Pods* will be launched on the newly labeled nodes. Wait for these *Pods* to be
in `Ready` state:

----
oc get pods -o wide
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP              NODE
glusterfs-3gjc5   1/1       Running   0          1m       {{NODE6_INTERNAL_IP}}         {{NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN}}  <1>

----
<1> The newly spawned GlusterFS pods.

[NOTE]
====
It may take up to 120 seconds for the GlusterFS *Pods* to be up and in _Ready_ state.
====

The new *Pods* run GlusterFS uninitialized. That is, they have not formed a
cluster among themselves yet. This is triggered via heketi.

heketi initializes vanilla GlusterFS *Pods* as part of loading the topology file.
Like during the cns-deploy phase in the link:cns-deploy["Deploying
Container-native Storage"] module it can read an additional cluster structure
from the JSON file.  This has already been prepared suitable for your
environment in the `/opt/lab/support/topology-extended.json`. It contains the
original 3 nodes we started with, and then newly added nodes.

Initialize the heketi-cli with environment variables like so:

----
export HEKETI_CLI_SERVER=http://heketi-{{CNS_NAMESPACE}}.{{OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX}}
export HEKETI_CLI_USER=admin
export HEKETI_CLI_KEY={{HEKETI_ADMIN_PW}}
----

This avoids repetitive command switches with heketi-cli. Use the heketi client
to load the new topology. Make sure you are currently in `/opt/lab/support`:

----
heketi-cli topology load --json=/opt/lab/support/topology-extended.json
----

And you will see something like:

----
	Found node {{NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN}} on cluster ec7a9c8be8327a54839236791bf7ba24

----

With this you've successfully initialized a second CNS storage cluster that is
managed by heketi. You can query heketi for the new topology:

----

<1> The internal ID of the new cluster managed by heketi

[NOTE]
====
The cluster ID will be different for you since it's automatically generated.
====

To use this cluster specifically, you can create a separate *StorageClass* for
it in OpenShift. PVCs issued against it, will only be served from this
particular CNS storage cluster. For this purpose, note it's internal heketi ID -
in the example above *ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c*.

There is a file on your system `/opt/lab/support/second-cns-storageclass.yaml`.
Open it with your favorite editor:

[source,yaml]
./opt/lab/support/second-cns-storageclass.yaml
----
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: cns-silver
provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
parameters:

  restauthenabled: "true"
  restuser: "admin"
  volumetype: "replicate:3"
  clusterid: "INSERT-CLUSTER-ID-HERE" <1>
  secretNamespace: "default"
  secretName: "cns-secret"
----
<1> The heketi internal ID of the new cluster is used to specifically direct
requests to it. *Replace it with the ID of your cluster!*

After you have correctly replaced your new cluster ID, create the `StorageClass`:

----
oc create -f /opt/lab/support/second-cns-storageclass.yaml
----

There is a *PersistentVolumeClaim* definition file that already has been placed
in `/opt/lab/support` for you:

[source,yaml]
./opt/lab/support/cns-silver-pvc.yaml
----
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-container-storage-silver
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: cns-silver
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
----

You can create it with the following:

----
oc create -f /opt/lab/support/cns-silver-pvc.yaml
----

This PVC will now be fulfilled by the _cns-silver_ *StorageClass*
which specifically directs the requests to the second cluster specified by its
UUID in the `clusterid` parameter of the *StorageClass*.

You can see that this claim is automatically bound:

----
oc get pvc
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                          STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE

### Other CNS Maintenance Activities
In addition to extending your CNS cluster with additional storage nodes, you may
also want to perform other maintenance activities. For example, if you have
added more block devices to one of your CNS nodes, you may simply wish to add
additional devices to the cluster. Or, if you have degraded physical devices
that need to be replaced, maintained, or eliminated, you may wish to remove
devices from a cluster.

#### Adding Additional Devices to a CNS Cluster
Instead of adding a net-new cluster you can also add additional devices to an
existing cluster. The process is very similar to adding new nodes - loading a
modified topology JSON file via the heketi client.

To illustrate an alternative we are going to use `heketi-cli` tool directly.

The nodes of the second cluster, have an additional, unused storage device
`{{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE2}}`. To add them we need to know their node IDs. + With the
environment variables for `heketi-cli` still set run:

----
heketi-cli node list | grep ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c
Id:33e0045354db4be29b18728cbe817605	Cluster:ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c
Id:d8443e7ee8314c0c9fb4d8274a370bbd	Cluster:ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c
Id:caaed3927e424b22b1a89d261f7617ad	Cluster:ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You will need to replace the `grep` with your unique cluster ID. This is the
cluster ID of the second / new CNS cluster that you just created previously, and
used when creating the new `cns-silver` *StorageClass*.
====

For each node in the output (eg: `33e0045354db4be29b18728cbe817605`,
`d8443e7ee8314c0c9fb4d8274a370bbd`, and `caaed3927e424b22b1a89d261f7617ad`), go
ahhead and `device add` the additional block device:

----
heketi-cli device add --name={{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE2}} --node=33e0045354db4be29b18728cbe817605
Device added successfully

heketi-cli device add --name={{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE2}} --node=d8443e7ee8314c0c9fb4d8274a370bbd
Device added successfully

heketi-cli device add --name={{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE2}} --node=caaed3927e424b22b1a89d261f7617ad
Device added successfully
----

[NOTE]
====
The node UUIDs will be different for you since they are automatically generated.
====

You can now verify the presence of these new devices by running:

----
heketi-cli topology info
----

You should see a `/dev/xvde` device present for each of the nodes in the
`cns-silver` cluster.

### Replacing Failed Disks and Nodes

Despite CNS' capability to continue operating transparently to the client in the
face of failing disks and nodes, you soon might want to replace such components
to move out of a degraded state.

For this exercise, let's assume the device `{{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE}}` of your node
{{NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN}} failed and you need to replace it. You can do that as
long as there is enough spare capacity somewhere else in the cluster,
preferrable but not necessarily in the same failure domain (as specifed in the
topology).

The first step is to, again, determine the CNS node's internal UUID in heketi's
database:

----
heketi-cli topology info | grep -B4 {{NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
----

You will see something like:

----
	Node Id: 33e0045354db4be29b18728cbe817605
	State: online
	Cluster Id: ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c
	Zone: 1
	Management Hostname: {{NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
----

Second, determine the device's UUID by querying the node (indicated above by
`Node Id`):

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
heketi-cli node info 33e0045354db4be29b18728cbe817605
----

You will see something like:

----
Node Id: 33e0045354db4be29b18728cbe817605
State: online
Cluster Id: ca777ae0285ef6d8cd7237c862bd591c
Zone: 1
Management Hostname: {{NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN}}
Storage Hostname: {{NODE4_INTERNAL_IP}}
Devices:
Id:01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff   Name:{{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE}}           State:online    Size (GiB):9       Used (GiB):1       Free (GiB):8
Id:da91a2f1c9f62d9916831de18cc09952   Name:{{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE2}}           State:online    Size (GiB):9       Used (GiB):1       Free (GiB):8
----

Notice the UUID of the device `{{NODE_BRICK_DEVICE}}` as shown.

[NOTE]
====
The device ID, as well as all other UUIDs in heketi commands are
automatically generated and different in your environment. Please be aware when
copy & pasting.
====

Third, mark the device as offline to stop heketi from further attempts to
allocate space from it:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
heketi-cli device disable 01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff
----

You will see something like:

----
Device 01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff is now offline
----

The device is now offline but it's still part of replicated volumes. To remove
it and trigger a self-healing operation in the background issue:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
heketi-cli device remove 01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff
----

You will see something like:

----
Device 01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff is now removed
----

This command can take a bit longer as it will go through the topology and search
for the next available device on the same node, in the same failure domain and
in the rest of the cluster (in that order) and trigger a brick-replacement
operation. This way data is re-replicated to another health storage device and
the 3-way replicated storage volume moves out of degraded state.

The device is still lurking around in _failed_ state. To finally get rid of it
issue:

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
heketi-cli device delete 01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff
----

You will see something like:

----
Device 01c94798bf6b1af87974573b420c4dff deleted
----

[NOTE]
====
Only devices that are not used by other Gluster volumes can be deleted. If
that's not the case `heketi-cli` will tell you about it. In this case you need
to issue a `remove` operation before.
====

You can now check that the device is gone from the topology by running:

----
heketi-cli topology info
----

Node deletion is also possible and is basically comprised of:

1. successful execution of the `remove` operation on all devices of the node
2. running `heketi-cli node delete <node_id>` on the node in question

### Running the OpenShift Registry with CNS

The Registry in OpenShift is a critical component. As it is the default
destination for all container builds in the cluster, and is the source for
deploying applications built inside the cluster, being unavailable is a big
problem.

The internal registry runs as one or more *Pods* inside the OpenShift
environment. By default the registry uses local ephemeral storage in its *Pod*.
This means that any restarts or re-deployments or outages would cause all of the
built/pushed container images to be lost. Also, only having one registry
instance and/or one infrastructure node could cause temporary outages. So,
adding storage and scaling up the registry is a good idea.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your cluster only has one infrastructure node. In practice, you would want a
minimum of two to achieve high-availability for all infrastructure services.
====

#### Adding CNS to the Registry
Adding storage to the registry is as easy as it was for our file-uploader
application. Simply make the registry *Pods* use a PVC in access mode *RWX*
based on CNS. This way, a highly-available scale-out registry can be provided
without external dependencies on NFS or Cloud Provider storage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following method will be disruptive. All data stored in the registry so far
will be lost (the Rails and PHP app images). Migration scenarios exist but are
beyond the scope of this lab, but normally you would configure persistent
storage for the registry before starting to really use your cluster.
====

Make sure you are logged in as `system:admin` in the `default` namespace:

----
oc login -u system:admin -n default
----

Just like with the file uploader example, you can simply add a volume (and have
its *PersistentVolumeClaim* created automatically) with the `oc volume` command.
Execute the following:

----
oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --name=registry-storage -t pvc \
--claim-mode=ReadWriteMany --claim-size=5Gi \
--claim-name=registry-storage --overwrite
----

The registry will now redeploy.

[NOTE]
====
The registry is preconfigured with a volume called `registry-storage` that is
using the `emptyDir` storage type. The above command `--overwrite` the existing
volume with our new PVC. More information can be found in the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/dev_guide/volumes.html[volumes
documentation].
====

[TIP]
====
In a future release of OpenShift, you will be able to configure Container Native
Storage as part of the OpenShift installation directly, including automatically
using CNS for the storage for the registry, fully supported.
====

Observe the registry deployment get updated:

----
oc get pod -w
----

Remember to kbd:[Ctrl + c] when you are done watching the *Pods* redeploy.

After a couple of seconds a new deployment of the registry should be available.
Verify a new version of the registry's *DeploymentConfig* is running:

----
oc get dc/docker-registry
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME              REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
docker-registry   2          1         1         config
----

Now your OpenShift Registry is using persistent storage provided by CNS.  Since
this is shared storage this also allows you to scale out the registry pods.

You can scale the registry like this:

----
oc scale dc/docker-registry --replicas=3
----

After a short while you should see 3 healthy registry pods in the default
*Project*:

----
oc get pods
----

And you should see something like:

----
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
docker-registry-2-5rszg    1/1       Running   0          1m
docker-registry-2-7s3tm    1/1       Running   0          14s
docker-registry-2-g3l70    1/1       Running   0          14s
registry-console-1-b47jt   1/1       Running   0          6h
router-1-hs9wp             1/1       Running   0          6h
----
